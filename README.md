# README for Scholarly Search Tool

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script for searching academic papers and publications via Google Scholar using the `scholarly` Python library. The script provides an efficient way to query Google Scholar and retrieve relevant academic information, including titles, authors, abstracts, and citation counts. It features caching to improve performance and reduce redundant queries.

## Features

- **Google Scholar Integration**: Leverages the `scholarly` library to search Google Scholar.
- **Proxy Support**: Includes a proxy setup to bypass any potential access restrictions on Google Scholar. You might want to adapt the proxy used : https://scholarly.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ProxyGenerator.html
